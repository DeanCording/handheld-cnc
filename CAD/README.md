Manufacturing BOM and Readme

Main Assembly (/latest) - 
Aluminum Sheet Metal (6061)
(1x) boardFrame.dxf - 1/4"
(1x) zCarriagePlate - 1/4"
(1x) crossPanel.dxf - 1/8"
(1x) UIPanel2.dxf - 1/16" (with engravings)
	- Note: the UIPanel2.ai file might be easier to use. It already has paths color coded
	- Note: this can be made in wood or acrylic too (1/8" should be fine) since it's not structural
	- Note: also, this UI scheme will also likely soon be deprecated, so this file will also likely be too.

Laser Cut Clear Acrylic
	- Note: these are for the UI which still hasn't been used yet. Pretty optional.
(1x) xStrip.dxf - 1/8"
(1x) yStrip.dxf - 1/8"

3D Printed Parts
	- Note: everything was printed in PLA but PET or Nylon or something stronger would probably be better.
	- Note: I think everything should be able to be printed with no (or minimal) support. Orient intentfully! (They might already be oriented correctly)
(1x) dremelMount.stl
(1x) dremelSinch.stl
(1x) frameRight.stl
(1x) handleLeft.stl
(1x) handleRight.stl
(1x) knob.stl
(1x) mainFrame.stl
(1x) pen_mount4.stl
(4x) springMount.stl
(1x) UIFrameLeft.stl
(1x) UIFrameRight.stl

Sensor Calibration -
Laser Cut Wood (or Acylic)
	- Note: not important, but 1/8" works well for all of these
(1x) calRailX.dxf
	- This is the calibration rail for the X component of the sensor
(1x) calRailY.dxf
	- This is the calibration rail for the Y component of the sensor
(1x) orient_frame.ai
	- This is used to check the calibration and rigid body kinematics of all four sensors
