Manufacturing BOM and Readme

Main Assembly (/latest) - 
Aluminum Sheet Metal (6061)
(1x) basePlate.dxf - 1/4"
(1x) zCarriagePlate.dxf - 1/4"
(1x) crossPanel.dxf - 1/8"
(1x) UIPanel2.dxf - 1/16" (with engravings)
	- Note: the UIPanel2.ai file might be easier to use. It already has paths color coded
	- Note: this can be made in wood or acrylic too (1/8" should be fine) since it's not structural
	- Note: also, this UI scheme will also likely soon be deprecated, so this file will also likely be too.

3D Printed Parts
	- Note: everything was printed in PLA.

Sensor Calibration -
Laser Cut Wood (or Acylic)
	- Note: not important, but 1/8" works well for all of these
(1x) calRailX.dxf
	- This is the calibration rail for the X component of the sensor
(1x) calRailY.dxf
	- This is the calibration rail for the Y component of the sensor
